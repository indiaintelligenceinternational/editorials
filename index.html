                        Not surprisingly, and by a bizarre leap of logic that only the Congress is capable of,
                        the main Opposition party has trained its guns on the government for the remark. The
                        Congress’ reasoning appears to be that Mr. Trump, the Prime Minister’s great friend who
                        was feted at rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad, has somehow stabbed Mr Modi – and by
                        extension India – in the back.

                        It will not be surprising if much of India’s attention on a less than intellectually
                        stimulating final Presidential debate in the United States will be focused on President
                        Donald Trump’s description of this country and its air as filthy.

                        Not surprisingly, and by a bizarre leap of logic that only the Congress is capable of,
                        the main Opposition party has trained its guns on the government for the remark. The
                        Congress’ reasoning appears to be that Mr. Trump, the Prime Minister’s great friend who
                        was feted at rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad, has somehow stabbed Mr Modi – and by
                        extension India – in the back.

                        One senior Congress leader asked sarcastically if the President’s remark was a “fruit of
                        friendship”. The correct question for the Congress to have asked was whether Mr. Trump
                        was right. Certainly, he is, if the daily reports on air quality emanating from the
                        National Capital Region are correct. He is just as right about the filthy state of the
                        country, notwithstanding the effort put into the Swachch Bharat initiative, because
                        outside select enclaves – a handful of them – India is a filthy place.

                        The proper response to this summation would be to redouble efforts to clean up both the
                        country and its air. And the Congress party could begin by asking its government in
                        Punjab to stop burning crop stubble and to introspect on all that it did or failed to do
                        during its years in power to contribute to this sorry situation.

                        A leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, too, has reacted to Mr. Trump’s statement by
                        admitting he is right, and then adding, “In Delhi, we are breathing poison”, as if to
                        suggest that the national capital – not ruled by the party – is the only place in the
                        country with filthy air. Gurgaon and Noida are parts of states that the BJP rules, and
                        the people there breathe the same poison that Delhi’ites do.

                        In short, and reacting along predictable lines, our political class finds every
                        opportunity to berate opponents without once making substantive efforts to address
                        problems. All of last year, and the years before, large swathes of northern India
                        grappled with foul air and winter pollution. Politicians talked up a storm, debated who
                        was more responsible, resolved to ensure that the right pollution control equipment was
                        procured, and announced grand plans to ensure the problem would go away the following
                        year.

                        And here we are, at the beginning of another winter, and back at square one, attempting
                        to slay a dragon with a flyswatter by ineffectually switching our cars off at red
                        lights. We have a Graded Action Plan in place to ensure how citizens can be
                        inconvenienced incrementally for the sheer incompetence of our political class. It isn’t
                        just our air that is filthy, it is our thinking.

                        world order

                        India pursuing an independent foreign policy is not only essential for the country or
                        the South Asian region, it can have a bearing on deprived populations of the world.

                        The face-off between India and China in Ladakh and the plans for annexation of the West
                        Bank by Israel have brought matters of global power dynamics to the fore. In the 1990s,
                        after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, commentators such as Francis Fukuyama were
                        quick in announcing the “end of history” and labelling ideology as unimportant and
                        irrelevant in the conduct of global politics. The supposedly unipolar world that came
                        into being after the Cold War, with the US acting as the global policeman and leader in
                        all institutions, facilitated the march of capitalism on a global scale. However, events
                        that unfolded later, for instance the 9/11 terror attacks, came to haunt the US and its
                        allies. Non-conventional security threats challenged the established conceptions of
                        security, war and modernity.

                        The 2008 global financial meltdown exposed the realities of the neoliberal world order.
                        Most institutions of lending crumbled before the inevitable logic of capitalism — the
                        cycle of boom and bust. The crisis rendered thousands unemployed and destitute. The
                        state had to bail out some of the largest financial corporations of the world with
                        public funds. The western world soon came to understand the importance of sharing
                        responsibility and adjusting to the new global realities such as the economic rise of
                        China and India. G-20 nations replaced the elite G-8 of rich countries in deciding the
                        economic course of the world, though within a neoliberal framework. This was an
                        arrangement to share power and skip responsibility, as it kept almost all poor countries
                        of the world out of decision-making. The rich got to decide what is best for everyone.

                        This established mechanism is under threat. The rise of China as the workshop of the
                        world has turned many western powers insecure. It has led to a trade war between China
                        and the US. Of particular relevance is the route India will take in the evolving bipolar
                        world with the US and China constituting the two poles.

                        India faced a similar situation at the time of Independence. Then, India refused to join
                        the Cold War camps and opted for a non-aligned foreign policy that championed the cause
                        of the colonised regions and the newly-decolonised parts of the world. In the recent
                        past, the Indian government’s foreign policy priorities have tilted towards the US and
                        the neoliberal framework. Tying Indian interests to the coat-tails of America will be
                        disastrous. The support for Palestine has been muzzled in this environment and
                        non-alignment abandoned as the government opted to play second fiddle to the US in Asia.
                        The US is trying to drag India into its conflict with China to protect US interests in
                        the Asia-Pacific region. The trade deals done to please the US have resulted in the loss
                        of livelihood, agricultural land and hard-won labour rights of Indian working classes.

                        What the world needs today is an international order based on the principles of mutual
                        respect, concern and cooperation and public participation. Privatised healthcare systems
                        imploded under the weight of COVID whereas countries with a socialised or socialist
                        public healthcare system fared better. The world needs to come together to build public
                        health and education infrastructure. India must reject both the unipolarity of the 1990s
                        and the bipolarity of the current system dominated by the US and China. India should
                        live up to its independent non-aligned credentials and play a constructive role in
                        evolving a more inclusive, multipolar and just world order.

                        In his address to the 75th General Assembly of the United Nations, Prime Minister
                        Narendra Modi reiterated the demand of India’s inclusion in the UN Security Council.
                        This demand is justified considering India’s history, size, economy and potential to
                        play a constructive role in global affairs. However, under the current dispensation,
                        these credentials have been tainted by multiple inconsistencies, especially in the
                        neighbourhood. India should use its UNSC chair to represent nations hitherto
                        unrepresented or underrepresented at the high table and continue the tradition of
                        speaking for the marginalised. Unfortunately, the course of Indian foreign policy in the
                        last few years does not correspond with this broad, inclusive worldview based on
                        solidarity.

                        In this context, India and China, as the world’s two most populous countries and
                        mega-economies, should engage in a meaningful dialogue to resolve the border dispute.
                        India should strive to make the world more inclusive, just and sensitive to the
                        environment. India pursuing an independent foreign policy is not only essential for the
                        country or the South Asian region, it can have a bearing on deprived populations of the
                        world.

                        Bihar is abuzz with electioneering. Promises and taller tales of opponent infamy fill
                        the air, quite apart from that tiny virus that has brought the world to its knees.
                        Indians are inured to the charm of poll promises — those that are not fulfilled can be
                        explained away as election jumla, or ploy. However, if no effort is made to implement
                        some, at least, of those promises, it can invite popular wrath, especially those with
                        the plausibility and appeal of government jobs and waiver of loans.

                        The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has promised to provide one million government jobs to
                        the people of Bihar, if the people vote it to power. This is the kind of populism that
                        can disempower the government even further. Ever since the government of Bihar
                        implemented the Sixth Pay Commission award for its employees, the state has been in a
                        state of perpetual fiscal stress. Bihar is at the bottom of most statewise rankings of
                        economic and social development indicators. Given its low base of economic development,
                        it has been possible for Bihar to notch up fast growth in several years; still, it
                        remains one of the least developed parts of the country.

                        It needs to spend on health centres, hospital beds, schools, teachers, courts, police
                        stations, roads and other infrastructure. Even more, it needs the spending to deliver
                        governance. It does not need to devote a still larger share of its funds on government
                        personnel. Bihar has managed to present several revenue-surplus budgets in a row.

                        That has not taken Bihar out of its rut. The Narendra Modi government had promised
                        several mega packages for Bihar, which had sounded good but have made little difference
                        on the ground. Bihar needs better governance, whose absence holds back progress. With
                        law and order, sugar factories could come up in Bihar.

                        With factories nearby, sugarcane cultivation can realise its innate, enormous potential
                        and make Bihar India’s sugar capital. That is the kind of change parties need to
                        promise, not to splurge more money on personnel the state can neither afford nor
                        productively administer

                        Post-GFC, China vacated about $140 billion in exports in unskilled-labour intensive

                        Post-GFC, China vacated about $140 billion in exports in unskilled-labour intensive
                        sectors, including apparel, clothing, leather and footwear. India did not take advantage
                        of this opportunity, created by China’s organic process of becoming richer and hence
                        less competitive in unskilled labour-intensive activities.

                        Now, post-Covid a second opportunity stemming from geo-politics has been created and
                        that is India’s big prize waiting to be seized. In fact, India still enjoys large export
                        opportunities, especially in labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and footwear. But
                        exploiting these opportunities requires more openness and more global integration.
                        Abandoning export orientation is thus akin to killing the goose that lays golden eggs.

                        ratifications of the Charter reached the required number for it to come into force.
                        Surviving for so long is by far the UN’s biggest success, and this itself is no mean
                        achievement. The UN is an inter-governmental organisation – it can only be what its
                        members make of it. Its predecessor, the League of Nations, had collapsed within two
                        decades due to military aggressions by the big powers leading to World War II.

                        The UN has survived the Cold War and the incessant quarrels among its permanent members
                        who lord over it. It has lived in the shadow of a third world war and many admirers give
                        it credit for averting such a war.

                        The primary purpose for setting up the UN was to maintain international peace and
                        security. The five big military powers, the victors of World War II, promised to jointly
                        protect the world from further wars. They made themselves permanent members of the
                        Security Council to be able to fulfil this grand assurance. Since they were to act
                        jointly, a negative vote by any of them became a veto.

                        The permanent five have never taken any military action jointly in these 75 years.
                        Instead, they have used the veto 254 times between them to kill resolutions.
                        Consequently, wars have been waged in many parts of the world, most of them with their
                        direct or indirect involvement. The US did not have to veto any resolution on the
                        Vietnam War because it commanded a comfortable majority in the Security Council in those
                        days. The Soviet Union had to do so only once during the Afghanistan War.

                        For a brief period of two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia and
                        China allowed the Western countries to take military action on behalf of the Security
                        Council in countries like Kuwait, former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Rwanda and Libya, but they
                        did not join the operations. The legality of some of these military actions was
                        questionable. But with no court to appeal to, this question has never been examined.

                        The short period of consensus among the permanent five vanished a decade ago and the
                        veto once again came to be used by the US, Russia and China. The moribund Security
                        Council now faces more serious challenges. The UN’s fate is inextricably linked with the
                        state of the global economy, which has been sluggish since the global financial crisis
                        of 2008. The resurgence of isolationism in the US and the rise of China have been
                        compounded by their trade war. The Covid pandemic has made the short-term scenario
                        gloomy all round.

                        The Security Council has to grow out of its five power mindset if it is to survive. The
                        permanent members are still the world’s leading military powers, but they have undergone
                        a sea change and the UN Charter needs to catch up. The Soviet Union no longer exists.
                        The Republic of China has been replaced by the People’s Republic of China. Both these
                        changes took place without an amendment to the Charter, which continues to list the
                        older entities.

                        Two other permanent members, France and the United Kingdom, are no longer the global
                        powers they were in 1945. France has joined the European Union which itself claims a
                        special status in the UN. The UK too was a member of the EU till recently. Both retain
                        their permanent seats but no longer have the stature to justify it.

                        The US is the only permanent member that retains its original form, but its commitment
                        to multilateralism is once again in doubt. But this pales into insignificance before the
                        much serious threat of the rise of China.

                        It’s a given that China will play an increasingly dominant role in the UN in the coming
                        years. Very little thought has been given by countries to the consequences of a
                        China-dominated international order. All permanent members have misused the veto to
                        escape censure in the Security Council and to control other organs of the UN. But China
                        displays utter contempt for the most basic obligation under the Charter “to refrain in
                        their international relations from the threat or use of force”. Its sabre rattling
                        against Taiwan is against the letter and spirit of the UN Charter even if it considers
                        it to be a Chinese province.

                        China demonstrates no commitment to other values of the UN like democracy, human rights
                        and the peaceful settlement of disputes. It is the only major country which is not a
                        party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It has also refused
                        to honour the ruling of an international arbitration in the dispute in the South China
                        Sea.

                        China seeks to dominate the UN system as no other country has done. Four of the 15
                        specialised agencies of the UN are now headed by Chinese nationals. Not satisfied with
                        this, China made a bid for a fifth international organisation earlier this year. It lost
                        in the final round to Singapore. China emulates Western countries in making voluntary
                        donations and placing its nationals in the secretariats of international organisations.
                        But it also adopts more questionable practices in its dealings with international civil
                        servants.

                        UN reform is no longer just about adding extra chairs to accommodate the wannabes. It’s
                        about its survival. It’s unlikely to complete its century on a pitch queered by China.

                        The CPC's fifth plenum and China's 14th Five-Year Plan 2021-2025
                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        I'm Robert Lawrence Kuhn and here's what I'm watching: The fifth plenum of the 19th
                        Communist Party of China Central Committee, its agenda and impact.

                        Foreigners wonder how China is thinking, where China is going? Party plenums are clues.
                        Party plenums are formal meetings of the Central Committee, the highest level
                        "Congress," as it were, of the ruling Communist Party of China, attended by more than
                        300 full and alternate members.

                        The fifth plenum marks an inflection point between China's two centenary goals: the
                        first, the moderately prosperous society, achieved this year, 2020, highlighted by the
                        elimination of all extreme poverty.

                        The fifth plenum rolls out a framework of China's 14th Five-Year Plan, 2021 to 2025, the
                        first five-year plan of economic and social development looking ahead 30 years to China
                        2050. The 14th Five-Year Plan is deemed critical, given decreasing international trade
                        such that demand for Chinese goods is less, and a volatile global environment such that
                        sensitivity to China's rise is more, thus preparing the country for economic challenges
                        at home and growing hostilities abroad.

                        The focus will be on what President Xi Jinping has called the "Double Development
                        Dynamics" strategy, rebalancing toward China's domestic market – according to
                        leadership, to "facilitate better connectivity between domestic and foreign markets for
                        more resilient and sustainable growth."

                        Essential is high-quality growth and self-sufficiency in science and technology –
                        hi-tech independence – especially the design and manufacturing of semiconductor chips,
                        which undergird all the frontier technologies: artificial intelligence (AI), 5G,
                        supercomputing, quantum computing, even smartphones. Other technologies include
                        renewables, material science, new energy vehicles, biotechnology, and space science.

                        The plenum will also present a midterm economic strategy called "2035 vision," the
                        half-way mark to China 2050, when China intends to become a fully modernized, socialist
                        nation and a great power in the world, particularly in science and technology and in
                        defense. This implements what Xi stated at the 19th CPC National Congress in late 2017:
                        China will "basically" realize socialist modernization by 2035.

                        According to a recent Politburo announcement, "We must seek development that has higher
                        quality, higher efficiency, higher fairness, higher sustainability and higher safety. We
                        must seek a synthesis of scale, speed, quality, efficiency and safety."

                        There are cautions. China's race for self-sufficiency in semiconductor chips, supplying
                        vast funding, can entice non-expert companies, with the all-too predictable failures and
                        wastes. Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission asserted that companies
                        with no experience, no technology, and no talent should stop blindly rushing into the
                        industry.

                        Advancing science and technology should be a global good in that all humanity benefits,
                        no matter the country of origin — the COVID-19 vaccine being a prime example. The
                        challenge for China in presenting its 14th Five-Year Plan, founded on science and
                        technology, is to show the world why all should root for, not against, its success.

                        Breakingviews - Samsung chairman bequeaths a tainted empire
                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Lee Kun-hee leaves behind an impressive, albeit deeply flawed, empire. The Samsung
                        chairman, who transformed his father’s noodle-trading business into a $355 billion
                        smartphone and chipmaking colossus, has died at 78. The second-generation leader’s mark
                        on Korea Inc will endure, but so do scandals that threaten the family’s grip on power.

                        To make an emphatic point about quality more than two decades ago, Lee set ablaze
                        150,000 of his company’s faulty mobile phones and fax machines in front of gathered
                        employees. The bonfire embodied a relentless drive to remake Samsung into a renowned
                        international brand alongside General Electric and Sony. It also underscored his
                        abrasive and exacting management style, which included long meetings and pointed
                        directives such as “change everything except your wife and children”.

                        After successfully putting Samsung on the map, Lee stepped down in 2008 following a
                        bribery and tax evasion conviction, alongside allegations that he helped his children
                        buy shares on the cheap. By then, the conglomerate spanned technology, insurance,
                        shipbuilding and more. Lee’s controversial investments in memory chips and mobile
                        handsets helped pave the way to challenge the dominance of Intel and Apple.

                        Not much should change operationally for Samsung. Lee had been incapacitated since
                        suffering a heart attack in 2014. His son Jay Y. Lee has been quietly leading from the
                        wings, overseeing new investments in smart-cars, next-generation 5G telecommunications,
                        biotechnology and more.

                        The younger Lee also has been embroiled in legal troubles. Just two years after he was
                        released from prison over his role in a bribery mess that led to the impeachment of
                        South Korea’s then-president, Jay Y. is on trial again over a controversial 2015 merger
                        between two Samsung affiliates that helped him assume greater control of Samsung
                        Electronics.

                        At issue is a tangled web of circular and cross-shareholdings of more than a dozen
                        company affiliates. The structure allows the family to exert control with small direct
                        stakes. Lee, for instance, held just 4.2% of Samsung Electronics, while Jay Y. owns
                        0.7%. It’s unlikely that the heirs, who don’t even have board seats in many Samsung
                        companies, can lead without an inheritance, which will be heavily taxed. Regulators are
                        also mulling new restrictions on opaque interrelated deals. Along with an incredible
                        corporate achievement, Lee bequeaths a giant governance mess.

                        The 'Quad' offers hope for a free and open Indo-Pacific
                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        As foreign ministers from the Quadrilateral countries — Japan, the United States,
                        Australia and India — met in Tokyo this week, speculation soared about the purpose of
                        the group. It is alternatively a gathering of concerned countries to contain a
                        revisionist China, a forum to promote a Free and Open Indo-Pacific region and even the
                        cornerstone of a nascent regional security architecture. The “Quad” (as it is called)
                        can be all those things but its future is uncertain, and its eventual form and content
                        depend on how it is managed.

                        The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue was launched in 2007 during Prime Minister Shinzo
                        Abe’s first term in office. It collapsed the following year when Australia withdrew
                        amidst criticism from Chinese officials that the group was an anti-China bloc and as
                        doubts grew over whether the participants shared aims and objectives.

                        Mounting concern about Chinese behavior prompted the four countries to try again. They
                        resurrected the Quad in 2017 and it has met at various levels ever since. This week’s
                        meeting was the second ministerial get-together; the first was last year in New York.

                        While all four governments are troubled by Chinese behavior, the United States has been
                        the loudest critic. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke for his administration
                        when he condemned China’s “exploitation, corruption and coercion,” and characterized its
                        actions as “bullying.” Japanese security planners agree, although they are unlikely to
                        use such blunt language. China poses a territorial threat given the dispute over the
                        Senkaku Islands and it is widely viewed as a revisionist power that seeks regional
                        preeminence, which will come at a significant cost to Japan.

                        Meanwhile, Australia objects to Chinese island building in the South China Sea (as do
                        the others), interference in its domestic politics and the sanctions imposed on exports
                        to China after Canberra complained about that interference and called for an
                        international investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak. India has had
                        decades of troubled relations with its neighbor to the north, culminating in armed
                        clashes along their disputed border in the Himalayas a few weeks ago that lead to the
                        deaths of dozens of troops.

                        While attention has focused on military exercises that underscore the Quad members’ aim
                        to give their cooperation teeth, discussions are much more extensive, encompassing —
                        among other topics — infrastructure, telecommunications systems (5G in particular),
                        cybersecurity, intellectual property protections and responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.
                        After this week’s meetings, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said the Quad
                        members agreed to meet regularly, discuss views of and cooperate on those issues and
                        others. He also reportedly proposed that the Quad broaden its cooperation with other
                        countries.

                        Expanding both the agenda and membership is a good idea, but it is still a long way from
                        Pompeo’s suggestion earlier in the week that the group be “institutionalized” and then
                        “build out to a true security framework,” with other countries joining “at the
                        appropriate time.”

                        That won’t be for a while. Strategic coordination is one thing; a formal security
                        mechanism is another. Japan has significantly strengthened security ties with Australia
                        and India, but it faces legal constraints in making security commitments to other
                        countries. All three countries — Japan, Australia and India — have issues with China but
                        they also want to calibrate relations in ways that account for their geographic,
                        economic and political realities. India’s refusal to join the Regional Comprehensive
                        Economic Partnership trade deal is a reminder of Delhi’s reluctance to tie its hands in
                        any formal way.

                        China will make it even harder. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin warned
                        against “forming exclusive cliques” and “targeting third parties or undermining third
                        parties’ interests,” and called for “open, inclusive and transparent” cooperation that
                        is “conducive to mutual understanding and trust between regional countries.” Wang
                        dismissed Pompeo’s plans to form a coalition as “nonsense,” adding “He won’t see that
                        day. And his successors won’t see that day either, because that day will never, ever
                        come.”

                        He may be right. China’s behavior remains worrying, however. The Quad nations, along
                        with other regional governments, know that their best chance of moderating Beijing’s
                        behavior is if they act together and speak in one voice. That does not mean that they
                        must adopt identical policies: There is room for nuance and variegation as long as
                        member governments are working toward the same goals and understand each other’s
                        objectives and tactics.

                        Institutionalized cooperation serves another purpose: It forces the U.S. to engage the
                        region too. The Quad provides a window on U.S. decision-making and offers partner
                        governments the opportunity to influence Washington’s thinking on issues that are of
                        vital concern to them.

                        While we share a commitment to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific region, that concept remains
                        elastic and our national commitments to realize that vision remain a work in progress.
                        The only way to make it real is through steady and ongoing communication, cooperation
                        and coordination. The Quad is a vital mechanism to do just that — whatever form it
                        takes.

                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        By Mata Amritanandamayi-
                        Amma knows many of her children are very sad and they are going through a lot of
                        challenges in their day-to-day life. Some of them might have lost their job. Some of
                        them are going through health issues. There are people who are unable to participate in
                        the weddings and other functions of their near and dear ones.

                        Some others are unable to attend funerals of their near and dear ones. But we should
                        never lose our inner strength. We should maintain our faith, and we should never loosen
                        our grip on the lotus feet of the divine.

                        To inspire her children, Amma shared an anecdote. When mountaineers climb a mountain,
                        they tie a lifeline to their waist, which is then fastened to the mountain. If they
                        slip, the lifeline won’t let them fall. Similarly, if we fasten our mind with the
                        lifeline of devotion to God, no matter how many difficulties we face, we will be able to
                        move forward in life without becoming mentally weak.

                        Though many situations in life are often not in our control, we can still plan how we
                        will respond. Many times, it is our response that causes the most problems in life.Once
                        a man was having breakfast with his son before going to work. While eating, the child
                        became excited and accidentally knocked over the man’s coffee and it got on the man’s
                        shirt.

                        The man became angry and shouted at his son. He went to change, but there wasn’t another
                        ironed shirt that matched his pants. So, he shouted at his wife for her inattentiveness.
                        She shouted back, and soon they were in a quarrel.

                        When the man went back downstairs, his son was still sitting in front of his breakfast,
                        crying. The wife had already left for work in a rage. So, the father had to get his son
                        ready for school. But by then, the school bus had already come and gone.

                        With no other option, he decided to drop the boy off on his way to work. As they were
                        late, he drove fast. Soon the police stopped him, and he got a ticket. So, he was
                        further delayed. They arrived at school late. The father was scolded by the teacher.

                        The man was supposed to reach his office by 10 am for an important meeting. He reached
                        at 10:45. Some of the VIPs who had come for the meeting had become impatient and left.
                        His boss was very angry and scolded him.

                        He was told to immediately come to the conference room with all the necessary documents.
                        To his shock, the man realised that, in his haste, he had forgotten his briefcase. His
                        boss was even further infuriated and fired him on the spot.

                        The man could have handled things very differently. He could have just said to his son,
                        ‘It’s okay. From now on be more careful.’ Then none of this would have ever happened.
                        This man had no control over the coffee getting spilled, but everything after that was a
                        ramification of the way he had reacted to the spill.

                        This is how things happen in our life as well. The current situation the world is facing
                        is not under our control. So, let us be strong and optimistic. To do this, we should
                        focus on the Eternal. We should hold tightly to the feet of Paramatma. This steadfast
                        faith and focus on the Paramatma can lift us beyond all kinds of limitations.
